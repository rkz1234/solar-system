        <h1 class="celestialobjects">1.Sun</h1>
        <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img class="image" src="sun.png"></marquee>
        <p class="para">
        Our Sun is a 4.5 billion-year-old star a hot glowing ball of hydrogen and helium at the center of our solar system. The Sun is about 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from Earth, and without its energy, life as we know it could not exist here on our home planet.The Sun is the largest object in our solar system. The Sun’s volume would need 1.3 million Earths to fill it. Its gravity holds the solar system together, keeping everything from the biggest planets to the smallest bits of debris in orbit around it. The hottest part of the Sun is its core, where temperatures top 27 million degrees Fahrenheit (15 million degrees Celsius). The Sun’s activity, from its powerful eruptions to the steady stream of charged particles it sends out, influences the nature of space throughout the solar system.
        NASA and other international space agencies monitor the Sun 24/7 with a fleet of spacecraft, studying everything from its atmosphere to its surface, and even peering inside the Sun using special instruments. Sun-exploring spacecraft include Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter, SOHO, ACE, IRIS, WIND, Hinode, Solar Dynamics Observatory, and STEREO.

    <section id="Mercury">
        <h1 class="celestialobjects">2.Mercury</h1>
        <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img  class="image" src="mercury.png"></marquee>
        <p class="para">
            The smallest planet in our solar system and nearest to the Sun, Mercury is only slightly larger than Earth's Moon.
            From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth,
             and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest
              planet in our solar system – that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere.

<section id="Venus">
    <h1 class="celestialobjects">3.Venus</h1>
    <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img class="image" src="venus.png"></marquee>
    <p class="para">
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is Earth’s closest planetary neighbor. It’s one of the four inner,
         terrestrial (or rocky) planets, and it’s often called Earth’s twin because it’s similar in size and density.
          These are not identical twins, however – there are radical differences between the two worlds.

<section id="Earth">
    <h1 class="celestialobjects">4.Earth</h1>
    <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img class="image" src="earth.png"></marquee>
    <p class="para">
        Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that’s inhabited by living
         thing. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system
          with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets
           closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.

<section id="Jupiter">
    <h1 class="celestialobjects">5.Jupiter</h1>
    <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img class="image" src="jupiter.png"></marquee>
    <p class="para">
        Jupiter has a long history of surprising scientists – all the way back to 1610 when Galileo Galilei found the first moons
         beyond Earth. That discovery changed the way we see the universe.Fifth in line from the Sun, Jupiter is, by far,
          the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
          Jupiter's familiar stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an 
          atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter’s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that
           has raged for hundreds of years.

<section id="Saturn">
    <h1 class="celestialobjects">6.Saturn</h1>
    <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img class="image" src="saturn.png"></marquee>
    <p class="para">
        Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest planet in our solar system.Adorned with thousands
         of beautiful ringlets, Saturn is unique among the planets. It is not the only planet to have rings made of chunks
          of ice and rock – but none are as spectacular or as complicated as Saturn's. Like fellow gas giant Jupiter,
           Saturn is a massive ball made mostly of hydrogen and helium.

<section id="Uranus">
    <h1 class="celestialobjects">7.Uranus</h1>
    <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img class="image" src="uranus.png"></marquee>
    <p class="para">
        Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, and has the third-largest diameter in our solar system.
         It was the first planet found with the aid of a telescope, Uranus was discovered in 1781 by astronomer
          William Herschel, although he originally thought it was either a comet or a star.

<section id="Neptune">
    <h1 class="celestialobjects">8.Neptune</h1>
    <marquee behavior="scroll" directin="right" ><img class="image" src="neptune.png"></marquee>
    <p class="para">
        Dark, cold, and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system.
        More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye and the first predicted by mathematics before its discovery. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846.
         Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune up close. It flew past in 1989 on its way out of the solar system.
